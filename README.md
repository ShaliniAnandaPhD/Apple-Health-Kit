# Apple-Health-Kit


The Apple HealthKit telemonitoring platform offers advantages over current hub-and-server technology for a segment of the primary care population. Although this easily
accessible telemonitoring platform has distinct advantages in terms of widespread dissemination, as well as a population with conditions amenable to telemonitoring, there remain
interoperability and data governance issues, reimbursment barriers, and provider concerns about the potential for large amounts of unfiltered telemonitoring data.

In bullet points - is Apple Health kit useful for startups

UPSIDE

- HealthKit registrants literally have technology in their hands to connect data directly to their primary care providers. 
- Lack of reimbursement for telemonitoring continues to be a barrier, and restrictive regional quality measures can hamper telemonitoring.
- Interoperability and governance issues also complicate transfer of telemonitored datainto the medical record.
- HealthKit does not solve the interoperability and governance issues. 

HealthKit does not show important associated BP data such as patient position (seated/standing), 
- Determining what data to upload into the
medical record, where to put it, and what metadata to include
are ongoing governance challenges. 

Because of these differences in validity such as seen with the finger and wrist BP monitors,18 data governance is needed to help differentiate incoming telemonitored data by validity
and other criteria. Providers also are not uniformly enthusiastic about this technology. Much like with the introduction of secure messages,20 providers are concerned about the volume of data
they will need to address. Patients are already sending dozens of BP readings in individual secure messages,21 so providers are concerned about receiving masses of unfiltered
BPs from Apple HealthKit or other mobile platforms. 

Primary care also needs processes to change treatments based on the telemonitored data. If the telemonitored data indicate high BP that needs treatment modification, then there needs to be
a process to contact the patient and change antihypertensive medication dosage or prescribe an additional antihypertensive.
